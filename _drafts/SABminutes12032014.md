# Student stipend/financial aid issue<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>

-   Trevor Alexander:
    -   Dean Crouch provided complete response&#x2013;students were taken seriously
        -   Dean response contained following main points:
            -   State/federal laws apply re: finaid
            -   Administrative policy
            -   Dean's interpretation
        -   Dean considers stipends and student employment pay definitionally separate
            -   Stipends "award for service" similar to finaid, necessarily fall within policy conditions as stated
                -   3 effects alleged by SAB do not apply in this case
            -   That said, student employment should not be compensated through stipends
    -   Recommend SAB produce summary article
        -   Main statement: urge students to refuse stipend positions if in doubt of financial aid status
        -   Contact SAB if you need help negotiating or have any questions concerning the policy
